      Under Dr. William Stacey
      -  Created an automated C++ text-parsing script that could extract relevant information from EEG comments file (.lay) and convert information to standard format used worldwide (BIDS format)
      - Created a computational toolbox and tutorial for generating synthetic EEG seizure data based on a mathematical model, enabling precise control over seizure onset and offset dynamics for use in developing seizure detection algorithms and training data analysis tools. Writing a manuscript on this work. 
      - Developed a seizure dynamotype classifier by creating a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline for EEG data, including high-pass and low-pass filtering, median filtering, sequence length normalization via cubic spline interpolation, and dimensionality reduction. Implemented data augmentation techniques such as series flipping to enhance model robustness. Applied sequence padding and data normalization to ensure consistent input shapes for neural networks. Constructed an LSTM neural network for classification of EEG signals, incorporating custom loss functions and evaluation metrics such as F1-score. Validated model performance through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, achieving improved accuracy on noisy and unbalanced EEG datasets. Created custom LSTM-GradCam to further understand the model classification.
      - Developed a sequence-to-sequence LSTM model in TensorFlow to remove white noise from EEG data. The model was trained on simulated EEG signals with white noise added at varying levels, then denoised to restore the original clean signals. Data preprocessing involved concatenating, reshaping, and padding the time-series data, followed by splitting it into training and testing sets. The model was optimized using mean squared error (MSE) to effectively filter out noise. The trained model demonstrated strong performance in removing white noise from the signals, improving data quality for subsequent analysis.

      Under Dr. Stephanie Preston
      - Assisted in Discomfort and Uncertainty in Autonomous Vehicles study exploring factors influencing passenger discomfort and trust in Autonomous Vehicles by measuring physiological stress responses and conducting post-ride surveys. 
      - Created and administered Qualtrics surveys to assess participant discomfort before and after riding in               autonomous vehicles.
      - Managed and assisted in a paid participant study, including physiological data collection (saliva samples, biometric monitoring) and analysis of survey responses.
      - Coordinated participant recruitment, scheduling, and compensation through the Prolific platform.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a student at the Univerity of Michigan studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science. My research interests include natural language processing, human computer interaction, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in the neurotechnology domain. I am apart of the Neural Engineering in Epilepsy Lab, where I develop seizure detection and classification algorithms, as well as toolboxes for mathmatical simulations.
